# A C++ library for building Slack-enabled applications

You want to connect your app or game with Slack. Or you want to write a Slack bot. And you want to do it in C++, because C++ is _awesome_. You want to build a rocketâ€”you need a rocket engine. Engine connects your application to the Slack [Web](https://api.slack.com/web) and [Real Time](https://api.slack.com/rtm) APIs.

## Prerequisites

A C++11 compiler, cmake 3.3, and an idea.

## Disclaimer

This library has only begun, and is a contant state of flux.
